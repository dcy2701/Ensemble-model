# Ensemble-model
This model is based on Ensemble-model(ADABOOST Classifier as well as Random Forest Classifier).
Dataset used- heart.csv from Kaggle.
I followed the following steps in the model:
(i). Extracting Features from the dataset and storing in y.
(ii). Then splitting the data as Training data and Testing data using Train_Test_Split.
(iii). After that I performed Scaling using MinMaxScaler.
(iv). First I trained the Model using Adaboost Classifier and then Tested it. Repeated the same step for Random Forest Classifier.
(v). It is thus concluded that Adaboost Classifier provided better model accuracy than Random Forest Classifier.
